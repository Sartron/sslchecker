0.1	- April 30 2017: Initial release, works.
0.2 - April 31 2017: Proper date parsing when comparing single digit days and double digit days.
0.3 - May 4, 2017
 Program will exit if unable to curl URL.
  Exit code 4: Connection timed out
  Exit code 5: Connection refused
 --resultonly properly outputs failure from exit codes 2 and 3.
0.4 - May 15, 2017
 Added --expired to return error code 2 in case user is checking for expiration status.
 Modified the formatting of the script output and added color.
 Removed multiple OpenSSL connections, curl and OpenSSL connection is only established once now.
 Corrected conditions that would cause the program to experience error or hang.
  Program requires both domain and port input to proceed, for some reason it was conditionally OR before.
  Implemented a timeout clause on the OpenSSL connection as it would hang for about 2 minutes otherwise.
 Code is generally more optimized, although fairly condition dependent now.
0.5 - May 24 2017
 Removed ParseDate() in favor of 'date -d' parsing.
  Certificate dates are now localized to system time
 Removed use of curl in favor of 's_client -servername' which supports SNI.
 SSL certificate is now just a check between fingerprints, which are entirely unique.
 Removed comparison results section, kind of pointless to show what can be seen already.
0.51 - May 24 2017
 Set OpenSSL variables back to global scope since local would interfere with exit codes.
 Removed 'https://' from exit code 5 and 6 output since no curl connection is being made.
 Removed some leftover references to curl.
0.52 - May 25 2017
 Optimized argument checking some.
 Fixed error that would occur when dig returned more than 1 value.
 Fixed incorrect exit codes.
  Argument failure: 2 -> 3
  Domain resolution fail: 3 -> 4
 Functions have better descriptions now.
0.53 - May 31 2017
 Certificates that are self-signed return 'none' as their organization rather than blank output.
0.6 - June 4 2017
 Adjusted arguments available for the script.
  Removed --resultonly, you may simply use the exit code and pipe stdout to /dev/null to achieve the same thing
  Added --san: Used to retrieve subject alternative name
  Added --output: Specify what OpenSSL connection is being outputted (No SNI vs. SNI)
 Restructured script design and optimized some code for use with new args.
 Updated patterns for issuer awk so it can handle non /CN= separators. This is to help fix GoDaddy-issued certificates which use /OU= as well.
 Added exit code 3 for certificates being not expired.
 Added a ShowHelp() function which is called when invalid args are supplied.
0.61 - June 8 2017
 Added default port of 443.
0.7 - June 11 2017
 Added support for connecting to an IP and not just a domain name.
 -d|--domain changed to -h|--host.
 Added --help.
 --san will output 'None' if there are no results.
 Improved the logic of parsing common name in situations where information is not sorted normally. (specifically this site I found called ninava.nahrainweb.com)
0.71 - June 14 2017
 Updated usage information as -p|--port is optional and not required.
0.8 - June 18 2017
 Added compatibility for CentOS 5 (servers without SNI) and servers without the tool 'timeout'.
  CompatibilityCheck() which will check to see whether or not the server supports SNI, as well if whether or not it has timeout
  Various features of the script are stripped or altered if theompatibility checks fail
 Improved error parsing by piping stderr to stdout for OpenSSL connections, and then parsing the text and not exit code.
 Script will now reject port 80 since OpenSSL won't work with that port.
 Script is generally more cleaned up and logical, although much larger.
 Fixed --expired so it can return exit code 2 and 3. Before, it only supported 2.
0.81 - June 20 2017
 Added clause to better catch generic errors as well as connections to ports sending an invalid protocol.
  Removed port 80 from unallowed ports.
 Added exit codes to '--help'.
 Tidied up README information.
0.82 - July 1 2017
 Tweaked ShowHelp() to produce less information when --help isn't provided.
 Added a clause for the certificate common name not being specified.
  This is needed because multi-domain SSL certificates may not have a CN and instead cover domains names within the SAN
